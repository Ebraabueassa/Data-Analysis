This script tracks stock prices over a given period and calculates daily price changes using simple subtraction. The data is manually entered, structured as a DataFrame, and analyzed by subtracting each day's price from the previous day's price. The results are visualized in a line graph to show stock fluctuations over time. A function could be added to load historical data from a file or access real-time stock data from an API, making the analysis more dynamic. This is a small example of how financial data can be processed and visualized using Python.
